# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0 - October 2025

This is the initial release of the Power Automate AI Builder Labs repository. It includes two comprehensive hands-on labs with step-by-step instructions for building automated workflows using Microsoft Power Automate and AI Builder. Lab 1 demonstrates invoice processing using AI Builder's prebuilt model and custom prompts, while Lab 2 covers creating and training a custom object detection model to identify green tea products in images. Both labs include integration with SharePoint for data storage and processing.

The repository contains all necessary sample files for testing, including 10 invoice PDFs for Lab 1 and 30+ training images plus 16 test images for Lab 2. A pre-built solution package for Lab 1 is also included. All lab instructions are provided in both Markdown and PDF formats, with organized screenshots in a dedicated folder for easy reference. The labs are compatible with both classic and new Power Automate designers and include comprehensive troubleshooting sections.
